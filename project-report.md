# Project Report: Sales Data Analysis

## Team and Roles
This project simulates team collaboration between Alex, Marc, and myself. Our goal was to develop a simple system to analyze and sort sales data from different company offices around the world.

## GitHub Usage

### Repository Setup
- Created a repository named `sales-data-analysis`.
- Added a `README.md` file to explain the purpose and functionality of the project.

### Issues
- Created an Issue titled **"Add sorting functionality for sales data"** to track the task.
- Labeled it as `enhancement` and assigned it to myself.

### Branching
- Created a new branch `feature-sorting` to work on the sorting functionality without affecting the main branch.
- Made two commits: one for the initial creation of the `sort_sales.py` file and another for improving the code.

### Commits
- Commit messages were meaningful and described the changes clearly.
- Used `Fixes #1` in the Pull Request to automatically close the issue when merged.

### Pull Request
- Opened a pull request from `feature-sorting` into `main`.
- Linked the pull request to the issue.
- Merged the pull request after reviewing the changes.

## Code Contributions
- Created a Python file `sort_sales.py` with sample logic for sorting data by revenue and region.
- Updated the `README.md` with a section describing the sorting functionality.
